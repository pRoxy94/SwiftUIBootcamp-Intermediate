 Swift uses Automatic Reference Counting (ARC) to manage your appâ€™s memory usage.
 ARC automatically frees up the memory used by class instances when those instances are no longer needed.
 
 As a developer, you want to try to keep the ARC count as low as possible, which will keep your app running fast and efficiently.
